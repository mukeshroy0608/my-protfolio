                <p>You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping 
                    trains. But nobody pays me a dime for that work. That's why I 
                    am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until 
                    I become the Web Development Hero.

                        I know everything needed to make a website 
                        function, efficient. I didn't stop with the 
                        web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript
                         framework called Vue JS. I even know the deployment,
                          server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.

                         remove web developer. I made their website and 
                         showed it to them. They liked it. And uploaded 
                         the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
